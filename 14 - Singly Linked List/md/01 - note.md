so a quick preface, a warning note. if you are unfamiliar with the _object oriented programing_ so go and check that out, the reason is that we are going to use that class keyword in pretty much every data structure we make or every data structure we create will define our own class

# Singly Linked List

## What is a Linked List ?

it a data structure, it store whatever sort of data you want, strings, numbers, it doesn't matter.

**A Data Structure that contains a _head_ and _tail_ and _length_ property.**
<br>

Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and pointer to another node or null

you can see in **visualgo** - a website were you can see how linked list work visually

## Comparisons with arrays

### Lists

- Do not have indexes!
- connected via nodes with next pointer
- Random access in not allowed

### Arrays

- indexed in order!
- insertion and deletion can be expensive
- can quickly be accessed at a specific index
