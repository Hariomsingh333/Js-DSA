## What do they do?

Data Structures are collections of values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

### Why so many ??

Different data structures excel at different things. some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

### WHY CARE?

the most time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
