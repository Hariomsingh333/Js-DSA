# Introduction to Problem Solving Approach

### _Algorithms and Problem Solving Approach_

## What is an **Algorithm**?

A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task. <br>

- _Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm !_

## Problem Solving Strategies

- Understand the Problem
- Explore concrete Example
- Break it Down
- Solve / Simplify
- Look Back And Refactor

### Step 1: Understand The Problem

1. Can i restate the problem in my own words?
2. what are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. what are the outputs the should come from the solution to the problem?
4. do i have enough information to solve the problem?

### Step2: Explore Examples

Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
<br>

- Start with simple Examples
- progress to More Complex Examples
- Explore Examples with Empty inputs
- Explore Examples with invalid inputs

### Step3: Break It Down

**Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.**
this forces you to think about the code you'll write before you wite it.

### Step4: Solve or Simplify

- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in
